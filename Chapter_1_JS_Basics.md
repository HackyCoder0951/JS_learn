> Can be reassigned and are only available inside the function they're created in. Its function scoped.

<span style="font-size:25px;color:red;"><b>2 - const variableName = value</span>

> Cannot be reassigned and not accessible before 
they appear within the code. Its block scoped.

<span style="font-size:25px;color:red;"><b>3 - let variableName = value</span>

> It can be reassigned but its similar to const i.e. block scoped.

>If variables are not created inside a function or block 
they are globally scoped.
